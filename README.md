# Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this program within a single function we have called all the three most useful functions of solidity to ensure authorization, condition and also the revert of remainig gas. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to the function in the Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
# Getting Started
## Executing program(Steps to be followed)
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar or click on new file button.

Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., module1.sol).

Copy and paste the code into the file:.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.17" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile module1.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Error" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "Speed" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the result.
